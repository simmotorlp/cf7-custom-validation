Fine-tune the validation copy for every Contact Form 7 field directly inside the form editor.

== Description ==
Validation Muse for Contact Form 7 lets you override the default error copy that Contact Form 7 displays. Enable the plugin per form, then supply custom text for required notices and invalid email, URL, telephone, number, range, and date validation. Messages are stored in post meta so they stay with the form when you export/import.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `cf7-custom-validation` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install it from the WordPress admin under Plugins â†’ Add New.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins screen.
3. Open any Contact Form 7 form, switch to the **Custom Validation** panel, enable the feature, and save your messages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require Contact Form 7? =
Yes. Contact Form 7 must be installed and active. The plugin will display an admin notice and automatically deactivate itself if Contact Form 7 is missing.

= Which field types support custom invalid messages? =
Email, URL, telephone, number (including range), and date tags can display custom invalid-format text. Any required field can have a custom "required" message.

= Where are the messages stored? =
Messages are saved in each form's post meta. They are included in Contact Form 7 exports, so migrating a form will move the messages with it.
